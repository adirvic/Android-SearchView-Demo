Android SearchView Demo
======================
This is a small demonstration of how I managed to get the Android [SearchView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/SearchView.html) widget working nice.
If you have been going mad trying to make the SearchView's autocomplete dropdown look nice with a dark action bar
then this code will help.
 

This is a standalone app supporting android versions 14 -> 28 featuring:

 - Proper material theme styling of the search view
 - How to wire up the search view to a ContentProvider
 - How to use the [SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider.html)

There is also an example of implementing a custom suggestion layout
