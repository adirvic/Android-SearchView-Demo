Android SearchView Demo
======================
This is a small demonstration of how I managed to get the Android [SearchView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/SearchView.html) widget working nice.
You can find the [source code here](https://github.com/danbrough/Android-SearchView-Demo) and you can also install it from 
the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=danbroid.searchview)

This is a standalone app supporting android versions 14 -> 27 featuring:

 - Proper material theme styling of the search view
 - How to wire up the search view to a ContentProvider
 - How to use the [SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider.html)
 -
